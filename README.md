# cathaSplit
cathaSplit is a cross-platform speedrun timer that lets you measure your run times and compare them to your personal bests.
I've written this software to familiarize myself with JavaFX GUI programming and to provide a speedrun timer that is cross-platform.

Keys:

F5 - Start Run

F6 - Split

F7 - Reset Run



This project is currently under development and supports LiveSplit's run files.

Global Hotkey support using: JKeyMaster (https://github.com/tulskiy/jkeymaster)
